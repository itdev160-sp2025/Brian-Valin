    <h1><u>Start Your Engines!</u></h1>
    <h2>Aetherdrift, <i>Magic, the Gathering</i>'s latest set is all about building up speed and taking home the gold!</h2>
    <p>Our first Standard-legal set of the year showcases ten racing teams from across the Multiverse as they compete in the
    most high-stakes competition that Magic has ever seen. The Ghirapur Grand Prix spans three different planes, and racers
    will do anything to win. Chandra is going to have to pull off some tricky maneuvers if she wants to win the Aetherspark,
    the race's grand prize.</p>

    <h1><u>Champions in the Making!</u></h1>
    <h2>Let's take a look at some of the impressive cards that are sure to drift all over Commander!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="robot">Brightglass Gearhulk</h2>
    <img src="images\Brightglass_Gearhulk.jpg" alt="Brightglass Gearhulk" width="450" height="600">
    <p class="robot">The Gearhulks are back, but this time they are two colors.  
        Will this limit their prevalence or will the modern design show that these powerful creatures are worth the price?</p>
    <p class="robot">Brightglass Gearhulk is a 4 mana selesnya creature with a powerful ability to search out two mana value 1 creatures.  
        Do you need protection? Grab yourself a Mother of Runes.  Card draw? grab an Esper Sentinel.  Removal? grab a Giant Killer</p>
    <p class="robot">Brightglass empowers all kind of toolbox creature decks throughout the format and is likely to see a lot of play!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="shark">Captain Howler, Sea Scourge </h2>
    <img src="images\Captain_Howler.png" alt="Captain_Howler" width="450" height="600">
    <p class="shark" class="sharkBump">Look at this beefy boy!  Captain of the Keelhaulers race team, this Shark Pirate and his flying rocket boats are here for the gold, and I'm not talking about medals!</p>
    <p class="shark" class="sharkBump">Captain Howler will make for an interesting Blue-Red Commander deck with a game plan only ever seen in Rielle, the Everwise before.  
        The question will be, do you use 1 at a time discard effects to maximize the card draw potential of the Captain, 
        or do you use wheel effects to discard a large number of cards and kill your opponents?</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="ketramose">Ketramose, the New Dawn</h2>
    <img src="images\ketramose-the-new-dawn.jpg" alt="Ketramose" width="450" height="600">
    <p class="ketramose">There's a new god on the scene folks!  And this one came to play!  looking like the most powerful card in the set for 60 card formats, 
        will Ketramose be equally powerful in Commander?</p>
    <p class="ketramose">Ketramose is a power card draw engine in the command zone, which is already a very good sign.  
        His synergy with a variety of cheap graveyard exiling artifacts will make it impossible to outgrind this powerful orzhov deck.  
        But, will the the deck be diluted with too many low power synergy pieces to make a powerful deck?  Only time will tell.</p>
